# Exercise 3: Pointer to a Struct

======================================

**Task**: Define a struct representing a `Person` with `Name` and `Age` fields. Write a function that takes a pointer to a `Person` and modifies its `Age`.

**Hint**: Think about how you access the fields of a struct when you have a pointer to the struct.
