# Exercise 1: Basic Pointer Usage

=================================

**Task**: 
Write a function in Go that takes an integer as a parameter and doubles its value. 
Use pointers to modify the original variable.

**Hint:** Remember to pass the address of the variable to the function and use dereferencing inside the function to change the value.
