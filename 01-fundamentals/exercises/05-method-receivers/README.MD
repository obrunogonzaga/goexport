# Exercise 5: Method Receivers
    **Task**: Create a struct representing a `Rectangle` with `length` and `width` fields. Write two methods: one that calculates the area and another for the perimeter. Use pointer receivers and test how they modify the original struct.
    Hint: Using pointer receivers allows the methods to modify the fields of the struct.
