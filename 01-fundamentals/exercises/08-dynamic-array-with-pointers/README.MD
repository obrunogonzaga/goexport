# Exercise 8: Dynamic Array with Pointers
    **Task**: Implement a dynamic array (similar to a slice) using plain arrays and pointers. Support operations like adding elements and resizing the array.
    **Hint**: You will need to keep track of the capacity and current size, reallocating the underlying array when needed.
